# SQL ReadMe


Hello All,

Welcome to my SQL portfolio. This code repository contains examples of SQL that I have written throughout my learning process.

Feel free to take a look and let me know if you have suggestions, thoughts. Here is my a link to all of my profiles: https://linktr.ee/jqts88. 
At this time I havent been posting my work for some time, and it is time for that to change. 

Some of thes code comes from a free course that I took in teh past beafore teh Google course. You can practice you code here and even go way more advance than teh google course goes you would like: https://learn.udacity.com/courses/ud198

Thanks for your time,

Jacque Trahan
