# This is how subqueries will look at work

# Find the name of each sales rep with teh highest sales(hint some regions rank at the top multiple times) 

# Made this in three steps. Step 1 find your sum total for each region:

	JOIN accounts AS a
	  ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
    
	JOIN orders AS o
	  ON o.account_id = a.id
	GROUP BY 1, 2

# STEP 2 get the highest amout for each region using the above table
SELECT 
  region, MAX(total) AS high_total
