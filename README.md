Progression with my python skill level.

This is a course provided by UDEMY. I had already started the book before the course began but they had a sale and decided to do both for positive reinforcement. 
Hearing the same thing i just read, help me retain the info, plus having visuals as someone explains thing is a MAJOR advanctage when it comes to me learning
new skills.
